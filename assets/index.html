        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The HTML is the frame</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web</li>
          <li>elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
          <li>the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content</li>
          <li>The alt text is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies. Alt text can also improve search engine rankings for your website</li>
          <li>The footer appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation</li>
          <li>section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>link element creates the connection to the external file</li>
          <li>the rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource</li>
          <li>the href attribute specifies the location (URL) to the external resource</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet. Let's explore these and then decide which approach we will use</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head </li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>The "local environment" is the workspace where each developer does their work independently on their own computer</li>
          <li>An integrated development environment, or IDE, is a type of software used by developers that combines many of the features needed by developers to do their work in a single interface</li>
          <li>An IDE contains many essential tools needed for code development such as a source code editor, local build automation, a debugger, and the ability to extend the IDE's capabilities with extensions to meet specific development needs</li>
          <li>When we create a new branch to add something new to our project, we call it a feature branch. That is because we are adding a new feature or functionality to our app</li>
          <li>In the feature branch, we make commits of all the changes we make to the code while working. We add a commit message that is descriptive of what changed in the code</li>
          <li>A pull request, or PR, is used to merge a comparison branch (in our case, the feature branch) into the base branch</li>
          <li>Once the PR is opened, other developers and collaborators on your team can view those changes you made to the code</li>
          <li>Once your PR is approved, you can merge it into the main branch</li>
          <li>Use "git add -A" to add code to current working branch</li>
          <li>Use "git commit -m 'your message here'" to commit changes to branch</li>
          <li>Use "git pull origin main" to pull any changes from the base branch</li>
          <li>Use "git push origin (enter branch here)" to push changes to the remote branch</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code</li>
          <li>Finally, we use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable</li>
          <li>We can use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument</li>
          <li>Note that whereas the style.css file is linked within the head element, the script.js file is linked within the body element</li>
          <li>You can also open Chrome DevTools using keyboard commands. If you are using macOS, you can press Command+Option+I</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true</li>
          <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy. If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets. If the condition is not true or has a value that is not truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on</li>
          <li>Sometimes we want to provide more conditions than just if. In JavaScript, we can have more than one condition—just like we did in the dishes pseudocode—by using else if</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way</li>
          <li>To create an array, we declare a variable in the same way that we declared a variable with only one data item. That is, we use var and then give the variable a name. However, instead of assigning the variable to a single value, we assign the variable to a group of values.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
          <li>A for loop contains a starting point for the loop, the condition, and the final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item </li>
          <li>At the most basic level, a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
          <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it</li>
          <li>To randomize our selection, we need to use a special Math function that helps us select a random number</li>
