        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The HTML is the frame</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web</li>
          <li>elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
          <li>the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content</li>
          <li>The alt text is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies. Alt text can also improve search engine rankings for your website</li>
          <li>The footer appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation</li>
          <li>section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>link element creates the connection to the external file</li>
          <li>the rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource</li>
          <li>the href attribute specifies the location (URL) to the external resource</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet. Let's explore these and then decide which approach we will use</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head </li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>The "local environment" is the workspace where each developer does their work independently on their own computer</li>
          <li>An integrated development environment, or IDE, is a type of software used by developers that combines many of the features needed by developers to do their work in a single interface</li>
          <li>An IDE contains many essential tools needed for code development such as a source code editor, local build automation, a debugger, and the ability to extend the IDE's capabilities with extensions to meet specific development needs</li>
          <li>When we create a new branch to add something new to our project, we call it a feature branch. That is because we are adding a new feature or functionality to our app</li>
          <li>In the feature branch, we make commits of all the changes we make to the code while working. We add a commit message that is descriptive of what changed in the code</li>
          <li>A pull request, or PR, is used to merge a comparison branch (in our case, the feature branch) into the base branch</li>
          <li>Once the PR is opened, other developers and collaborators on your team can view those changes you made to the code</li>
          <li>Once your PR is approved, you can merge it into the main branch</li>
          <li>Use "git add -A" to add code to current working branch</li>
          <li>Use "git commit -m 'your message here'" to commit changes to branch</li>
          <li>Use "git pull origin main" to pull any changes from the base branch</li>
          <li>Use "git push origin (enter branch here)" to push changes to the remote branch</li>
